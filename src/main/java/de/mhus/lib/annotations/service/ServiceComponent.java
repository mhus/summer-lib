     * A bean manager has a recipe for the construction and injection of an object value. However,

     *
     * <p>singleton - The bean manager only holds a single component instance. This object is
     * created and set when the bean is activated. Subsequent requests must provide the same
     * instance. Singleton is the default scope. It is usually used for core component instances as
     * well as stateless services.
     *
     * <p>prototype - The object is created and configured anew each time the bean is requested to
     * provide a component instance, that is, every call to getComponentInstance must result in a
     * new component instance. This is usually the only possible scope for stateful objects. All
     * inlined beans are always prototype scope.
     *
     * <p>Implementations can provide additional scope types. However, these types must only be
     * allowed when a defining namespace is included in the definitions and is actually used in the
     * definitions to specify the dependency on this feature.
